Pong Game 11/4/2017
=======================

Description
-----------------------
A recreation of the classic Atari arcade game Pong, released in 1972.

Made with the instruction of Chris DeLeon and his Udemy class "Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in Javascript on Canvas" (url: https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/learn/v4/overview).

This course and project expanded my perspective on the capabilities of programming and the Javascript language. I gained exposure to real-time mouse inputs, very basic artificial intelligence, and reinforced general programming concepts (variables, functions, if statements).
